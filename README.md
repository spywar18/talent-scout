## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Libraries & Dependencies
- **Streamlit**: Frontend web application framework
- **OpenAI**: GPT-3.5-turbo for natural language processing
- **Python-dotenv**: Environment variable management
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation (if needed for analytics)
- **Dataclasses**: Structured data management

### Core Components

#### 1. ConversationState Enum
Manages the chatbot's current state:
- `GREETING`: Initial welcome message
- `COLLECTING_INFO`: Gathering basic candidate details
- `TECH_STACK`: Collecting technical skills
- `GENERATING_QUESTIONS`: Creating tailored questions
- `ASKING_QUESTIONS`: Technical assessment phase
- `ENDING`: Conversation conclusion

#### 2. CandidateInfo Dataclass
Stores candidate information:
```python
@dataclass
class CandidateInfo:
    full_name: str
    email: str
    phone: str
    experience_years: str
    desired_position: str
    current_location: str
    tech_stack: List[str]
```

#### 3. HiringAssistantBot Class
Main chatbot logic with methods:
- `get_llm_response()`: Interfaces with OpenAI API
- `extract_info_from_response()`: Parses user input for structured data
- `generate_technical_questions()`: Creates tech stack-specific questions
- `process_message()`: Main conversation handler

### Model Architecture
- **Primary Model**: GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Context Window**: Optimized for conversation length
- **Temperature**: 0.7 for balanced creativity and consistency
- **Max Tokens**: 500 per response for concise interactions

## üîß Prompt Engineering Strategy

### Information Extraction Prompts
```python
system_message = """
You are an information extraction assistant. Extract candidate information from the user's message.
Return ONLY a JSON object with specified fields...
"""
```

### Technical Question Generation
```python
system_message = """
You are a technical interviewer. Generate 3-5 relevant technical questions 
based on the candidate's tech stack. Questions should assess practical knowledge...
"""
```

### Design Principles
1. **Clear Instructions**: Specific, unambiguous prompts
2. **Structured Output**: JSON format for consistent parsing
3. **Context Awareness**: Include relevant candidate information
4. **Adaptability**: Handle diverse tech stacks and experience levels
5. **Error Handling**: Fallback responses for API failures
